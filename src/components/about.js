            <p>2020 brought problems and challenges that no one could have foreseen. This is especially true for the charities who support Australia’s most vulnerable people. Whether it’s drought, bushfires or COVID, each development brings a new set of needs for a different group. And with money tight for everyone, donors are pulling back on everything but the most relevant causes. Charities are not web developers, and struggle to keep their content and campaigns relevant.</p>
            <p>CampaignBuilder is an app that enables anyone to build a microsite for a new cause. By completing a simple
            form, any user can build a new campaign for the charity. On the homepage, the user answers a series of questions
            about the cause. From here, they can search for and select relevant case studies, and set up a recommended donation.</p>
